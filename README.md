# Home_Sales
Module 22 Challenge

The code for the challenge was completed in Google Colab using PySpark and SparkSQL. Afterward, the completed Home_Sales_colab.ipynb was downloaded and saved in this GitHub repository. No problems were encountered during the creation of the code and all tasks were completed successfully. The project provides important metrics about home sales data by using Spark to read in the source csv file, creating a temporary table view, caching the data, partitioning the data, then finally uncaching the temporary view.
